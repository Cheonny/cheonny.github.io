Dyspraxia Assessment
-There are two stages to carry out the Dyspraxia Diagnosis:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First stage - Preliminary Dyspraxia Assessment 

- In the first stage, one or one’s parents will have to work with the expert psychologist to draft a 
  developmental history to record whether symptoms of the person being accessed are consistent with Dyspraxia. 
- The developmental history will then be refined during the structured interview based on the Diagnostic and 
  Statiscal Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5). A test known as Detailed Assessment of Speed of 
  Handwriting (DASH-17) will also be carried out which tests the rate and pace of handwriting, the size and 
  formation of letters, legibility of handwriting (the script written on line) and overall coherence of writing.


Second stage - Face-to-Face Element of Dyspraxia Diagnosis 

- The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Coordination (Berry VMI) is used in this stage to 
  identify visual motor problems associated with Dyspraxia and tests how well the person can integrate motor 
  and visual skills. 
- Typing tests will also be included as some people with Dyspraxia will find typing using a computer keyboard 
  is challenging. DASH-17 is used again to identify which area the person needs most support on handwriting 
  difficulties and agree on an action plan for improvement. 
- Movement Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition (Movement ABC-2) is used to assess a child's movement 
  while at home which includes an examination of the amount of time taken to finish the activities that require 
  physical movement and how this interacts with the child’s confidence, behaviour, psychological and physical 
  well-being.
- People with Dyspraxia often have difficulties with working memory and processing information. Thus, the 
  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for children or adults is used to evaluate both working memory and processing speed.
- Sensory Profile 2 also included as it is an assessment that evaluates a person’s sensory processing patterns as 
  this might impact on functioning effectively at work, at home or in education.
